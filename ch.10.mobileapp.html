        System Error-there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
        Programmer Error-the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
        User Error-the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.

        Stack Trace-This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
                 << index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
                    at three (index.html:13)
                    at two (index.html:17)
                    at one (index.html:21)
                    at index.html:24`
                this is an example of how a stack trace works.

        Warnings: A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
         This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic, 
         since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.

         EvalError- is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility.
          It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.

        RangeError- is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.

        ReferenceError- is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.

        SyntaxError- is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.

         TypeError- is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.

        URIError- is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.

        InternalError- is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.
