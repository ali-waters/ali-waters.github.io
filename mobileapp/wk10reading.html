WK 10 READING------

Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, the delay caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.

**apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server side and the client side**

"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).
"Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).
"Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).
"Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data format is required for your data).
    ^^^^^This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.

why do we insist on validating our forms? There are three main reasons:

We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.
We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application

USING BUILT IN FORM VALIDATION
required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)
min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types
type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type. 
pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.

FETCH API---


The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

basic fetch structure:
        fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });

Send a Request with credentials included->
  To cause browsers to send a request with credentials included, even for a cross-origin call, add credentials: 'include' to the init object you pass to the fetch() method.

fetch('https://example.com', {
  credentials: 'include'
});
