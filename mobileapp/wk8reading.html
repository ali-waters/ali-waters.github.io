The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. While some of these effects were possible using previously existing CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.

Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left , moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike position: relative , which allows you to position an element either against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.

The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:

The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing different values will distort the element, as you’d expect:

The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis:

transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
