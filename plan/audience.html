    <h1>Audience</h1>
    <body>
        <h2>The target audience of this site will mainly be people in the area but also anyone who wants to stay caught up on current events that are going on in the country</h2>
        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <p>The first persona will be a man about 35, who is visiting the site because he is planning a snowmobiling trip for his family. He is curious to what the upcoming weather will be like and want to make sure they will be safe. The second will be a college student, their family lives south and she wants to go visit but doesn't want to drive in horrible weather, she checks to see what times will be the safest for her to drive. Another scenario would be a man looking at the site on his smart phone because he heard about an earthquake that killed several people, or a woman wanting to send a donation to help any recent disasters on her desktop at work, and finally a teacher showing her students how to access and navigate a safe weather site so they can learn computer skills and the web.</p>
